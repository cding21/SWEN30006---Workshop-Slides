# SWEN30006---Workshop-Slides
A repository of workshop slides used in SWEN30006 - Software Modelling and Design workshops. These slides will be uploaded on a weekly basis, if there are any issues please me know. 

Best of luck for the semester ahead!

## What is Software Modelling and Design (SWEN30006)?
Software systems must be carefully analysed and designed as part of the construction process; this subject teaches the knowledge and skills needed for this. Topics include requirements analysis and modelling, including use-cases and domain models; software design processes and principles; some common design patterns and architectural styles; software tools for analysis and design; and, the Unified Modelling Language (UML). The emphasis will be on techniques appropriate for object-oriented development.
